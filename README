Assignment information: Assignment #1, HexDump. A basic hexdump program that opens a binary or text file, reads every byte in
the file and writes both the ASCII and hex value or Binary value for that byte as well as the corresponding printable character
to standard output. For bytes forming non-printable characters, prints a dot character


File manifest: xbd.cpp, xdb.h, Makefile, README.
Compile instructions: make
Operating instructions: To output in binary format then type xbd -b <filename>. To output in Hexadecimal
format then type xbd <filename>


List/description of novel/significant design decisions: The program is divided into two main functions,
handleHex and handleBinary, that dump the conents of the file in hex or binary depending on the arguments given.

List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality you included which were not required: N/A
List/description of all known deficiencies or bugs: N/A

Lessons Learned: Learned that we could use the hex and bitset functions by including libraries instead of making
functions from scratch to convert to hex and binary respectively. Learned how to read from file, how to make 
header and Makefile. Also learned how to work in a team and collaborate on github.
